## Why I Am Interested in Software Engineering:

I am interested in software engineering because it combines problem solving logical thinking and the ability to build tools that can have a real impact on everyday life. As a computer science student I am motivated by the idea of learning practical skills that can lead to a stable and rewarding career. Software engineering interests me not just as a specific area of study but as a field that values adaptability and continuous learning. I want to understand how software is created improved and maintained over time rather than only focusing on getting a program to work once.

## Skills I Want to Develop:

One of my main goals is to develop skills that will help me succeed in a professional environment. This includes learning how to quickly pick up new skills or refresh old ones as they become necessary on the job. I know that technology is always changing and it is unrealistic to rely on a single language or tool long term. Being able to read documentation understand unfamiliar code and adjust to new tools is just as important as writing code itself. I want to feel confident walking into new technical situations and figuring out what needs to be done.

I am also focused on building a strong understanding of basic programming concepts such as iteration recursion sorting and organizing data. These ideas show up in almost every programming language and are essential for writing good code. By improving my understanding of these fundamentals I hope to write code that is easier to read easier to maintain and more efficient. I want to move away from guessing and trial and error and instead be able to think through problems in a clear and logical way.

## Gaining Experience and Looking Forward:

Through my classes and projects I hope to gain hands on experience applying these skills in realistic situations. Working on assignments fixing bugs and improving programs over time helps reinforce both my technical knowledge and my problem solving skills. Overall my goal is to build a flexible skill set that prepares me for a variety of software engineering roles and allows me to continue learning and growing throughout my career.
