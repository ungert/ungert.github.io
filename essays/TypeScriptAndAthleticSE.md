## Learning TypeScript:

As someone who is still fairly new to coding, my experience with TypeScript has been more positive than I had expected. I have taken a few classes that used Java, C, or C++, so I was not completely unfamiliar with programming concepts, but I would still consider myself a beginner overall. TypeScript does not feel drastically different from those languages and because of that, it feels like a natural step forward rather than something entirely new or overwhelming.

Using TypeScript has helped me reinforce basic coding ideas such as functions, loops, iterations, and breaking down problems to manageable bits. I am starting to feel like I understand what code is doing instead of just copying patterns and hoping they work. That may be partly due to my repeated exposure to programming in general, but TypeScript has helped by making errors more visible and easier to reason out. From a software engineering student perspective, that structure feels helpful rather than restrictive.

## Athletic Software Engineering and the WODs:

I have been really enjoying the athletic software engineering approach. The WODs have been very useful because they force me to actually write code instead of just reading about it. They also encourage me to use documentation and outside resources, which feels like a more realistic approach. The repeated practice makes concepts stick better than traditional homework alone.

At the same time, the timed nature of WODs can be stressful, especially knowing that time affects the grade. The stress does not come from the coding itself as much as from the pressure to finish quickly. Because of that, I feel pushed to rely more on generative AI than I would otherwise, simply to make sure I complete the task on time. That pressure can take away from the learning experience in some cases.

Overall, I still think this style of learning will work well for me. The practice WODs in particular seem like a good place to experiment, think through problems, and make mistakes without heavy penalties. Over time, I believe this approach will help me become a better programmer by building both technical skills and problem solving habits. Even when the WODs are challenging, they push me to engage with the material in a way that feels active and meaningful.
